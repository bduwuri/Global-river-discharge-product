Global River Discharge Project

This project aims to develop a comprehensive global river discharge estimation system using remote sensing data, advanced machine learning techniques, and explainable AI methods. \
\
Key Features \
1.Utilizes multi-source satellite data: \
  GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) for water storage changes\
  MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) for surface water extent\
  IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) for precipitation estimates\
  \
2. Implements multimodel approach using state-of-the-art machine learning models:\
  Ensemble Trees (XGBoost, Random Forest)\
  Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\
  Support Vector Regression (SVR)\
  Gaussian Processes (GP)\
  \
3. Incorporates Explainable AI techniques for model interpretation and transparency\
